## Coding standards

### Functional Programming
TTunnel uses functional programming. So its better to use functions, not classes.

### Single Responsibility Principle.
Functions should do one thing. If they do more than one thing, they should be split into separate functions.

### Return early with Guard Clauses
Functions should return as early as possible.

### Perfer async/await over callbacks
Callbacks can get messy, so wherever possible use async/await instead.

### ES6 Modules
Wherever possible, use ES6 modules over commonjs ones, even if sometimes commonjs modules are unavoidable.
